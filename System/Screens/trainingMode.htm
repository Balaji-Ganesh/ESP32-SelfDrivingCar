      <h1>Training Mode</h1>
      <p>
        In this mode, car is set in training mode. For purpose of training - all
        the navigation controls, camera feed and ultrasonic feed are record for
        training.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user will be like a guide in issuing proper controls based on the
        surrounding environments. Note that, the quality of training data has
        direct impact on training. i.e., to say - if had bad training, then
        performs worst, vice versa if good training.
